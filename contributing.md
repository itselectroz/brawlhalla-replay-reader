# Contributing to **brawlhalla-replay-reader**

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports),
[features requests](#features) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests),
but please respect the following restrictions:

- Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests.

- Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; make sure that the code in the repository is
   _definitely_ responsible for the issue.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

## Features

Feature requests are welcome, but please take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to _you_ to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail, context and reasoning as possible.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are helpful. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the projectâ€™s developers might not want to merge into the project. The easiest way to do so is creating a feature request first and ensuring it isn't already being worked on.

## Formatting

We use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. A configuration file is already in the repository, please use this when working on the repo.
